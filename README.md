# JCalculate
A unified Java programming library for calculating any math equation(s).
To compile, on Windows: download and install Java and JDK, then run the compile.bat script inside the install_compile folder, and change the directory to whatever you like in the script file.
To compile, on Linux: same, but run the compile.sh script, and do the same steps.
To compile, on Mac: same, run compile.sh and do the same steps.
Import this into your Java code by using the following code:

```java
import openjdk.jcalculate.*;
```
